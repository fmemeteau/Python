# A dictionary, be it in Python or from real life, can be seen as a table, where the left part (a word in a dictionary)
# is a 'key' and the right part (the definition) is the 'value'

# The syntax to create a dictionary in Python is 'dictionary = {Key: Value}'
# Copying the example from the course would be :
# {"Bug": "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected."}

# Each Key / Value pair is separated by a comma :
# {"Bug": "Something",
# "Function": "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again." 
# }

# Retrieving an item from a dictionary :
# print(dictionary["Bug"])

# Adding a new item :
# dictionary["Loop"] = "The action of doing something over and over again."

# Create an empty dictionary :
# dictionary  = {}

# Wipe an entire dictionary :
# existing_dictionary = {}

# Edit an item in a dictionary, simply write a new value :
# dictionary["Bug"] = "A moth in your computer"

# Loop through a dictionary :
# For key in dictionary:
#   print(key)
# would simply display the name of the keys.
# To display the values as well, do :
# For key in dictionary:
#   print(dictionary[key])
