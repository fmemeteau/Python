# You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys are the names of the students
# and the values are their exam scores. Write a program that converts thei scores to grades.
# By the end of the program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades containing the names as keys and their grades as values.

# This is the scoring criteria:
#   91 - 100 : "Outstanding"
#   81 - 90 : "Exceeds Expectations"
#   71 - 80: "Acceptable"
#   70 or lower: "Fail"
